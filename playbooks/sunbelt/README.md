# Sunbelt Playbook

This folder houses the strategy, plan and run artefacts for **Sunbelt Rentals**. Use the accompanying `plan.md` to define how the scraper should navigate the Sunbelt website and extract pricing. Each run produces a timestamped folder under `runs/` containing the context, raw scrape, ETL output, artefacts, agent notes and final report.
