# Run plan: unitedrentals

SYSTEM:
You are Patriot’s pricing agent. Follow the steps exactly.

CONTEXT (auto‑injected by runner):
- Patriot SKU slice
- Config hashes
- Temporal run‑id

GOALS
1. Fetch per-day/week/4-week rates for each Patriot SKU using strategy below.
2. Normalise output.
3. Fill template.md into report format.

STRATEGY
- Navigate to the United Rentals product page for each SKU. United often embeds pricing in a downloadable PDF.
- Use Playwright to click the “PDF” link and download the rate sheet.
- Use the ETL package to parse the PDF and extract daily, weekly and monthly rates.
- Use Stagehand recipe `united.pdf.yaml` if PDF download fails.

BLOCKERS
- `UNITED_PDF` handled via Stagehand recipe `.chatrunner/united.pdf.yaml` (placeholder).
